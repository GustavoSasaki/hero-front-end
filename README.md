## About
[Hero Creation](https://hero-front-end.vercel.app/) is a CRUD for super heroes with IA image generation in the format of a web-app.

It was created based on Tour of Heroes tutorial with the object of improving mine angular and CSS skills. 


## Stack
- Front-end: HTML and Angular.
- Style: CSS with Tailwind.
- Back-end: Next hosted on Vercel.
- Database: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase.
- Image Creation: OpenAi API. 

I could have used an NodeJs server with Express to the back-end. But I already knew how to hosted Next in Vercel, so I was lazy
